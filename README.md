Feedly Background Tab (Tampermonkey):
=====================================

This repository contains a Tampermonkey user script that allows selected feedly.com articles to be opened in a background tab.
It is an alternative solution to using a [Chrome Extension](https://github.com/koenhausmans/feedlyBackgroundArticles).
