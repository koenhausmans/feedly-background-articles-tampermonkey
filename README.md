Feedly Background Tab (Tampermonkey):
=====================================

This repository contains a Tampermonkey user script that allows selected feedly.com articles to be opened in a background tab.
It is an alternative solution to using a [Chrome Extension](https://github.com/koenhausmans/feedlyBackgroundArticles).

How to use:
-----------
 1. Install Tampermonkey in the browser
 2. Chrome: Enable `"Allow user scripts"` under the Tampermonkey manage extension page
 3. Open the `src/feedly-background-tab.user.js` file and click on the `Raw` button to automatically add the user script to Tampermonkey
